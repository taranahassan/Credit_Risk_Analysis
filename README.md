# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Credit card credit data has been acquired from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending service company, to assist in evaluating which machine learning methods/algorithms offer the best predictions for credit risk.  This analysis will be used to help FastLending, another peer-to-peer lending service, who would like to introduce machine learning methods to their loan application process.  They believe this would be more efficient in time and accuracy to identify good candidates for loans and therefore reduce the default rates.

## Results: 
Six machine learning models have been used to identify the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
